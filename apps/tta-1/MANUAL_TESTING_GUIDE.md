## 1. Introduction
**Goal**: Verify the "Teacher's Teacher Assistant" (PRASHIKSHAN) application is production-ready.
**Scope**:
- File Upload & Analysis
- AI Lesson Improvement
- Data Persistence (Database)

---

## 2. Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure:
- [ ] App is running (`pnpm dev` -> http://localhost:3003)
- [ ] Database is connected (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- [ ] **Test Data**: Locate `apps/tta-1/test_data/extensive_student_data.csv`

---

## 3. Scenario 1: Upload & Analysis 📊
**Action**:
1. Go to the Home Page.
2. Drag & Drop `extensive_student_data.csv` into the upload area.
3. Enter Class ID: `9B`.
4. Enter Teacher ID: `T-Manual`.

**Expected Result**:
- File is accepted.
- File size and name are displayed.
- No errors appear.

## 4. Scenario 2: Lesson Improvement 🤖
**Action**:
1. In the "Initial Lesson Content" box, paste:
   > "Today we are learning about linear equations. We will solve x + 5 = 10."
2. Click **"Analyze & Improve Lesson"**.

**Expected Result**:
- Loading spinner appears ("Analyzing...").
- After ~5-10 seconds, the **Results Dashboard** appears.
- **Class Analysis**: Shows "Linear Equations" as a weak topic (based on the CSV data).
- **Final Lesson**: The AI should have rewritten your lesson to include more examples or word problems to address the weakness.

## 5. Scenario 3: Data Persistence 💾
**Action**:
1. Refresh the page.
2. Check your Database (using `prisma studio` or a DB client).
   ```bash
   pnpm prisma studio
   ```

**Expected Result**:
- You should see a new entry in the `AnalysisRun` table.
- The `classId` should be `9B`.
- The `finalDraft` should match what you just saw.

## 6. Conclusion
If all steps pass:
- ✅ **Frontend** is working.
- ✅ **AI Agents** are working.
- ✅ **Database** is saving data.
- ✅ **Production Ready**.
